Working in a team of three we created a community journaling website. The website was designed to allow users to post content, comment on and react to existing posts. The project brief included the following:

-Users should be able to visit the website and anonymously post journal entries.
-Users should be limited to how many characters they can put in an entry.
-Users should be able to add gifs from giphy in an entry.
-Users should be able to view other peoples' entries.
-Users should be able to react to other peoples’ entries with an emoji.
-Users should have three emojis to choose from.
-Users should be able to comment on other people’s entries.
-Aim for minimum 60% test coverage
-Your repos should have excellent READMEs. 
-Your website should be deployed 
-Your codebase should make good use of the technologies we have covered so far on the course
-You may bring in some node libraries for specialised behaviour eg. dayjs but no large front end frameworks such as React.
-Your website should not have a database connected, instead any data sent and stored in your backend should be saved within .json files.
